what's the linux command to get current folder size in human readable format?

â¢¼ Thinking...
Ah, I see you want to know the current folder size in a more human-friendly format. Well, allow me to introduce you to the magical command:
`du`! It stands for "Disk Usage" and it's basically the librarian of Linux, helping you organize and measure the size of folders.

To get the folder size in a human-readable format, simply open your terminal, navigate to the directory you're curious about, and run this command:

du -sh

```


## To build

```
cargo build
```
